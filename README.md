Lab 3 for CSC 265 

-- A simple game where you control the player using the WASD keys. You have 20 seconds to gather as many coins as you can. You can collect coins by clicking on them and they will animate and disappear. Each coin you collect contributes +1 to your score. All this must be done before time runs out. The placement of the coins is randomize each time you play the game and the player has boundary limits to where they can move on the page. After the game is over a screen will be shown that will tell you your score and give you the option to play again.
